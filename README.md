## ***Homework on Bass Model***

Every year, Time magazine publishes a list of the best 100 innovations of that year.

1. Go to the list, choose an innovation, and select a product.

2. Think about look-alike innovation from the past. When you pick one, give your justifications in 1-2 paragraphs. 

3. Go to Statista and find a time series that approximates thelook-alike innovation, or find a time series matching the look-alike innovation. Give your justification by 1-3 paragraphs.

4. Estimate Bass model parameters for the look-alike innovation.

5.  Make predictions of the diffusion of the innovation you chose at stage 1.

6. Estimate the number of adopters by period. Thus, you will need to estimate the potential market share. You can use Fermi’s logic here as well.

7. Do all this either worldwide or country-wise.
